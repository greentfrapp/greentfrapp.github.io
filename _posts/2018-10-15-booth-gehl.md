This was an assignment for my Master's program in Urban Science, Policy and Planning. The purpose was to attempt to replicate some of Charles Booth and Jan Gehl's methods in a local district (Simei East in Singapore) and reflect on the entire experience.

In the 1880s, Charles J. Booth and his merry band of surveyors, school inspectors and police o cers took to the streets for a detailed census of the population, resulting in a set of detailed notebooks and statistics.

Of particular signicance are the beautiful maps visualizing geographical wealth distribution and helping the government confront the fetid living conditions of the poor.

> The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, Whyte, 1979

Nearly a century later, William H. Whyte’s The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces captured pedestrian rituals in public spaces - what is affectionately known as the ‘sidewalk ballet’ (Jane Jacobs, 1961) - using time-lapse photography and video.

In a similar vein, architect and urban designer Jan Gehl focuses on documenting human life - likely emerging from early conversations with his wife Ingrid Mundt, a psychologist (Matan & Newman, 2016).

In this report, I reflect on the structured observation methods of Booth, Whyte and Gehl and consider their place in the 21st century, by adopting similar methods to observe the residents of East Simei.
