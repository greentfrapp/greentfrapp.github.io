## Colletta di Castelbianco

This [Italian village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colletta_di_Castelbianco) was cited as an example of urban planning's fascination with technology. Colletta was abandoned in the 1950s and subsequently restored in the 1990s, in both the architectural and the technological. Italian architect [Giancarlo De Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_De_Carlo) developed the restoration plan for the architecture. On the other hand, Valerio Saggini reimagined Colletta as a high-tech workplace with furnished with telecommunication infrastructure. The target audience were refered to as *white eagles* - 'people who work by themselves and are looking for isolation, but who also use computers and information electronics to remain in touch with what’s happening' ([De Carlo, 2004](https://placesjournal.org/assets/legacy/pdfs/colletta-di-castelbianco.pdf)).

**Architectural Restoration.** The Italian architect Giancarlo De Carlo published a short [journal article](https://placesjournal.org/assets/legacy/pdfs/colletta-di-castelbianco.pdf) describing his experiences and thoughts on the project. The article is surprisingly conversational and definitely worth a read. De Carlo talks about his efforts to balance preservation and renovation - a particularly tangled dilemma for Singapore's districts that *age in place*. Some interesting takeaways include his discussions on space and connections, as well as his discovery of the *genetic code* of Colletta. 

> It goes very slowly because you cannot go very fast in this case. You have to work on each piece and put together things and stop and understand and start again, etc. It takes a lot of time to make the design of such a humble place.

*De Carlo's parting words on the Colletta project.*

**Mismatch?** Colletta seemed to have been cited during the lecture as an example of a failed mismatch between technology and urban design. However, as mentioned earlier, there was a rather specific target audience that Saggini had in mind and this [2008 article](http://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/colletta-di-castelbianco-liguria) seems to indicate that Colletta had a fair share of buyers. Although [a site](https://colletta.it) advertising rentals seemed to have a lack of visitors (see availability in link), [Airbnb rentals](https://www.airbnb.com.sg/s/Castelbianco--Italy) at Castelbianco seem to be doing well. So it might not be a *failed mismatch*, although it is probably not a resounding success either.

Here is a [1998 article](https://web.archive.org/web/20180119205934/https://www.teleura.com/article/articleview/13/1/14/index.html) reporting on the Colletta project (stored in the Wayback Machine).
