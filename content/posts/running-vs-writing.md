title: 'Running is different from writing. Or maybe not.'
---

Roughly a year ago, I found out how to keep running [^1] . Now I regularly run 60 to 70km a week and it rarely feels like a chore or something I dread.

Now I'm trying to start writing more frequently again, because I want to think clearer thoughts.

One of the things that helped with running is simply the idea of prioritizing consistency:

**No matter the pace or the distance, just clock a run.**

The truth is, running at an amateur level really does not require "deliberate practice" to improve. So I simply show up and run everyday, and enjoy the run without thinking too deeply. And I get better unconsciously.

On the other hand, the key to better writing seems to require significant deliberate practice. Simply showing up everyday and writing a few mindless sentences doesn't help.

Similarly, time-bound running is fruitful: running for 30 minutes results in tangible calories burned and cardiovascular training. But writing for 30 minutes as an amateur often fails to yield any result. Case in point, these 10ish sentences took me about 1 hour of writing and rewriting.

So why do I sound like a non-runner trying to explain why I don't run? [^2]

[^1]: Dynomight wrote a post (5min read) that I agree wholeheartedly with: [How to run without all the pesky agonizing pain](https://dynomight.net/2021/01/25/how-to-run-without-all-the-agonizing-pain/). Here's a key excerpt: "You should think as follows: You are starting a habit you will keep for decades. It doesn’t matter how hard you run today. What matters is (1) that you do run, and (2) that you enjoy it enough that you’ll run again tomorrow. That’s it."

[^2]: I started out fully intending to describe why running is different from running. Along the way, I was struck by the tremendous irony of what I set out to do, and this is the result.
