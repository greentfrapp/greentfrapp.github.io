Fact: Cleopetra lived nearer in time to the release of the iPhone than to the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Here's another fact: The T-Rex lived nearer in time to the release of the iPhone than to the Stegosaurus.

It's always fun to share these and remind myself that we have a pretty funky grasp of natural history and civilization timelines.
This essay is a place to share more about the rabbit hole I fell into when researching these.

The idea for this had been floating around in my mind for several months.

I can't remember the first time I heard about the T-Rex/Triceratops fact, or the Cleopetra/Pyramids fact.
I did speak about something very similar a decade ago for an undergraduate class presentation about the history of human civilization.
But the genesis for this specific essay was definitely https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html, which I came across on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44266828) in June 2025.
Then life happened and I procrastinated for many months, before the final impetus struck after reading Elizabeth Hanlon's translation of Liu Cixin's Of Ants and Dinosaurs. Specifically the opening prologue, which went something like:
"If the entire history of the Earth were condensed into a single day, one hour would equate to 200 million years, one minute to 3.3 million years and one second to 55,000 years. Life would appear as early as eight or nine o' clock in the morning, but human civilization would not emerge until the last tenth of the last second of the day."

As observed frequently elsewhere, humans often struggle with big numbers.
