title: 'the discomfort is the point.'
---

The primary purpose of every post on this site is to help me get better at thinking and reasoning.

I fully expect to run into difficulty expressing myself.

And have writing blocks.

And realize my entire premise is flawed only after spending hours on an essay.

Using LLMs here feels like planning a run then driving a car instead.

The discomfort *is* the point.
